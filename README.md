# miniPython-Compiler-Implementation
This project implements a compiler for the miniPython language, which is a subset of Python. The project involves four main phases: lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, abstract syntax trees (AST), and semantic analysis using symbol tables. The implementation uses the SableCC tool to facilitate the construction of the compiler.
